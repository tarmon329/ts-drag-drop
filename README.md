# TypeScript Drag & Drop
 A productivity app that allows you to start a new project and drag it from the projects list to a list of finished projects when finishing it.
The TypeScript course I took led me to create this app -
I learned topics such as decorators, interfaces, and generics and incorporated them into the app.
-- The app uses Webpack as a compiler.

# [`The Client`](webclient/src/index.js):
